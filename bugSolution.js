Debugging this type of error requires a systematic approach.  Here's how you might improve your debugging process:

1. **Enable remote debugging:** In your Expo development client, enable remote debugging. This gives you access to the JavaScript debugger and allows for stepping through your code to identify the point of failure.

2. **Console logging:**  Strategically place `console.log` statements throughout your code to track the execution flow and identify variables' values at various stages. This helps you understand the application's state before the crash or freeze. 

3. **Error boundaries:** Implement React error boundaries (`<ErrorBoundary>`) in your application to catch errors and render fallback UI. While this won't prevent the crash, it can give you a clue about the component encountering the issue.

4. **Simplify the UI:** Begin with a minimized app version. Gradually reintroduce components to identify the component causing the crash.

5. **Asynchronous Operations:** Pay close attention to promises, async/await, and other asynchronous operations.  Unhandled rejections or errors within these can lead to silent crashes.

6. **Memory Management:** Examine memory usage, especially if dealing with large data sets. Memory leaks or excessive memory allocation could cause performance issues that lead to instability.   Profiling tools can be helpful here.

7. **Expo Updates:** Ensure you're using the latest versions of Expo and your dependencies. Sometimes, bugs are fixed in newer releases.
